Rust social network analysis through Rust using SNAP graphs of Facebook and Twitch users. 
Analyzing the six degrees of separation idea and investigating whether degree differences exist for different types of networks.
Found that differences did in fact exist as there was a 37% greater degree of separation for Facebook than Twitch.
